# BlinkStick Toys

solid.py
Sets all LEDs on the blinkstick to a solid color.

rotatingrainbow.py
Makes a full spectrum of colors spin around all LEDs on the blinkstick.
Theoretically looks nice on something like the BlinkStick Square but I have no
idea. If someone could report back on that, that'd be great.

lavalamp.py
This one was actually an accident while I was working on rotatingrainbow.py. It
slowly morphs through a variety of colors. Looks pretty alright IMO.

rotatingcolors.py
Blue background with a rotating green dot that leaves a trail behind it. For the
moment, colors and everything else is hardcoded. This will change someday.

# Requirements
You need python2 or 3.
Obviously you'll need the blinkstick python module.
Also the time and colour python modules.
And colorsys and math, but I'm pretty sure those are preinstalled.
Actually I think time is too tbqh.
Whatever, if you find anything missing just "sudo pip install <it>".
