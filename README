## BlinkStick Toys ##

solid.py
Sets all LEDs on the blinkstick to a solid color.

rotatingrainbow.py
Makes a full spectrum of colors spin around all LEDs on the blinkstick.
Theoretically looks nice on something like the BlinkStick Square but I have no
idea. If someone could report back on that, that'd be great.

lavalamp.py
This one was actually an accident while I was working on rotatingrainbow.py and
I decided to run with it. It slowly morphs through a variety of colors and is
*very* vaguely reminiscent of a lava lamp.

rotatingcolors.py
Blue background with a rotating green dot that leaves a trail behind it. For the
moment, colors and everything else is hardcoded. This will change someday.

breathing.py
It creates a breathing effect, fading smoothly between two colors. A sine wave
just wasn't cutting it. This fades in quickly, pauses just a tiny bit, then
fades out slowly.

fire.py
Breathing.py wasn't very fun to watch from in bed, so I made this. Everybody
loves falling asleep staring into the heart of a dying fire. For those of us who
aren't lucky enough to be camping, we have this poor imitation.

fireflies.py
This script came about when I was playing around with the crackling effect on
fire.py. Change one "min" to a "max" and suddenly I got the beginning of this
script. I stripped out everything fiery and worked on a bit more until it looked
good. Maybe not good, but at least alright I think.

# Requirements

You need python2 or 3.

Obviously you'll need the blinkstick python module.

Also the time, colour, and colorsys python modules.

And colorsys and math, but I'm pretty sure those are preinstalled.

Actually I think time is too. And maybe colour. And definitely colorsys.

Whatever, if you find anything missing just "sudo pip install <it>".
