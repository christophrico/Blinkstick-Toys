## BlinkStick Toys ##

solid.py
Sets all LEDs on the blinkstick to a solid color.

single.py
Sets a single LED on the blinkstick to a solid color.

rotatingrainbow.py
Makes a full spectrum of colors spin around all LEDs on the blinkstick.
Theoretically looks nice on something like the BlinkStick Square but I have no
idea. If someone could report back on that, that'd be great.

lavalamp.py
This one was actually an accident while I was working on rotatingrainbow.py and
I decided to run with it. It slowly morphs through a variety of colors and is
*very* vaguely reminiscent of a lava lamp.

breathing.py
It creates a breathing effect, fading smoothly between two colors. A sine wave
just wasn't cutting it. This fades in quickly, pauses just a tiny bit, then
fades out slowly.

fire.py
Breathing.py wasn't very fun to watch from in bed, so I made this. Everybody
loves falling asleep staring into the heart of a dying fire. For those of us who
aren't lucky enough to be camping, we have this poor imitation.

fireflies.py
This script came about when I was playing around with the crackling effect on
fire.py. Change one "min" to a "max" and suddenly I got the beginning of this
script. I stripped out everything fiery and worked on a bit more until it looked
good. Maybe not good, but at least alright I think.

sky.py
This is supposed to imitate the sky during a clear or cloudy day.

storm.py
Draws rain or snow falling.

stripes.py
Rotates 2 color stripes.

stars.py
Draws a night sky, occasionally punctuated with a shooting star.

# Requirements

You need python2 or 3.
Obviously you'll need the blinkstick python module.
And if you're using manager.py you'll need python-forecastio.
Also the time, colour, and colorsys python modules.
And colorsys and math, but I'm pretty sure those are preinstalled.
Actually I think time is too. And maybe colour. And definitely colorsys.
Whatever, if you find anything missing just "sudo pip install <it>".
